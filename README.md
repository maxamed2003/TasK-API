 **Personal Task Manager API**
- Simple Task Manager API is a Node.js-based API designed to manage personal tasks with CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This API stores tasks in a JSON file and includes optional image upload support for each task. The server uses the native HTTP module, with routes configured based on request type and URL.
## Features
- Retrieve All Tasks: Fetch all tasks stored in the JSON file.
- Create a New Task: Add tasks with title, description, status (default is "pending"), and optional image upload.
- Update an Existing Task: Modify task details such as title, description, status, and image.
- Delete a Task: Remove a task by its unique ID.
- Static File Serving: Serves a main HTML page located at the root URL.
